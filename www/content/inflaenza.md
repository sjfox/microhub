The **INFLAenza** model uses a Bayesian hierarchical framework implemented with Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) to forecast respiratory hospitalizations. It includes smooth seasonal effects using a cyclic random walk over week-of-season (epiweek) and captures short-term trends with autoregressive temporal components. Forecasts are generated using a Poisson likelihood with an optional population offset. For technical details, read the <a href="#" id="inla_methodology">methodology.</a>

Use this when you need a flexible model that captures both seasonal structure and evolving short-term dynamics.
