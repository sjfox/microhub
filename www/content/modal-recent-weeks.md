Decreasing the number of **recent weeks** to match against ($n$) provides a larger number of close matches to recent data, which increases forecast uncertainty and makes the forecasts less opinionated (i.e. it flattens the forecasts). We typically reduced $n$ during the end of the respiratory virus season, which prevents the forecasts from relying on only a single spline trajectory to produce its forecast when it is matching against dozens of consecutive weeks.
