**Data to Drop** controls whether or not the most recent data are used in the forecast model. During real-time forecasting efforts there can sometimes be significant backfill to the recent data points based on reporting delays. Thus, the user of the tool can inspect the recent data to determine whether they would like to use all available data (0 weeks), exclude the most recent week (1 week), or exclude the most recent two weeks (2 weeks) of data. Selecting the proper number of weeks to exclude is often an iterative process, where a best guess is selected, then a forecast run with the plot inspected, and then altering the data to drop as needed.
