**Forecast Horizon (Weeks)** corresponds to how many weeks of forecasts you desire. The models by default provide four weeks of forecasts which correspond to Horizon 0, 1, 2, and 3, with horizon 0 indicating admission forecasts for the MMWR Week containing the specified Forecast Date (with date specified as the Saturday following the selected Wednesday date). We allow forecasts to be made for up to 8 weeks, but would caution that historically forecasts have only been reliable 3-4 weeks in advance. Note that the forecast horizon specifies which horizons you want forecasts for, but dropping weeks of data will internally extend the forecast horizon. 

For example, with the default settings of dropping a week and asking for four forecast horizons the models actually are providing five predictions (horizons -1, 0, 1, 2, and 3), since they first need to predict the week of the dropped data. To find out the true horizon of the prediction, then, one must add the `Data to Drop` values to the `Forecast Horizon` values.
