Increasing the allowable **respiratory week range** ($R$) allows more matches for a particular trajectory, which can add weight to a single trajectory. Values of $R$ will generally lead to the lowest uncertainty in forecasts and increasing it will lead to more uncertainty. We did not tune $R$ much over the season, so it is unlikely to need to be tuned, but may be necessary if recent weeks ($n$) is greatly reduced to prevent overfitting to a single trajectory.
